##What is ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling
AR: lags of the differenced series
I : number of difference used to make the time series stationary
MA: lags of errors

##Assumptions of ARIMA model
1. Does not depend on time (stationary).Example: white noise series and series with cyclic behavior.
2. Univariate data (one variable). Auto-regression works with the past values.

```{r}
#Use astsa package
library(astsa)
data()                     # use this command to view all the loaded data 
```

```{r chicken}
#Convert dataset to ts using Monthly price of a pound of chicken
tsData = ts(chicken, frequency = 12)
```

#Understand the four components of a time series data:

##Observed - the actual data plot
##Trend - the overall upward or downward movement of the data points 
A long-term increase or decrease in the data is referred to as a trend. It is not necessarily linear. It is the underlying pattern in the data over time.
##Seasonal- any monthly/yearly pattern of the data points 
When a series is influenced by seasonal factors i.e. quarter of the year, month or days of a week seasonality exists in the series. It is always of a fixed and known period. E.g. - A sudden rise in sales during Christmas, etc.
Cyclic: 
When data exhibit rises and falls that are not of the fixed period we call it a cyclic pattern. For e.g. - duration of these fluctuations is usually of at least 2 years.

##Random - unexplainable part of the data
```{r chicken}
components.ts = decompose(tsData)
plot(components.ts)
```
#Test for stationarity of the data:
-constant mean
-constant correlation over time
```{r}
stationary.ts = diff(tsData)
plot(stationary.ts)

#cor.test(tsData, lag(tsData, -1))
#cor.test(tsData, lag(tsData, -6))
```
```{r}
#To remove seasonality from the data, we subtract the seasonal component from the original series 
seasonally_adj.ts <- tsData - components.ts$seasonal
#difference it to make it stationary
stationary.ts <- diff(seasonally_adj.ts, differences=1)
plot(stationary.ts)
```
```{r}
acf(stationary.ts, lag.max=34)
pacf(stationary.ts, lag.max=34)
```

```{r}
fitARIMA <- arima(tsData, order=c(1,1,1),seasonal = list(order = c(1,0,0), period = 12),method="ML")
library(lmtest)
coeftest(fitARIMA) 
```

```{r}
#Remove insignificant coefficients
confint(fitARIMA)
```

```{r}
acf(fitARIMA$residuals)
library(FitAR)
boxresult <- LjungBoxTest (fitARIMA$residuals,k=2,StartLag=1)
plot(boxresult[,3],main= "Ljung-Box Q Test", ylab= "P-values", xlab= "Lag")
qqnorm(fitARIMA$residuals)
qqline(fitARIMA$residuals)
```

```{r}
library(forecast)
#Find the best model
auto.arima(tsData, trace=TRUE)
```

```{r}
#n.ahead specifies the number of steps to predict
predict(fitARIMA,n.ahead = 5)
```

```{r}
#Generate and plot MA
x <- arima.sim(list(order = c(0, 0, 1), ma = 0.9), n = 100)
plot(x, main="MA(1)")
```
```{r}
#Generate and plot AR
x <- arima.sim(list(order = c(2, 0, 0), ar = c(0, -0.9)), n = 100)
plot(x, main="AR(2)")
```

```{r}
#Estimate AR(2) with mean =50
x <- arima.sim(list(order = c(2, 0, 0),ar = c(1.5, -.75)),n = 200) + 50
#Analysis of residuals
x_fit <- sarima(x, p = 2, d = 0, q = 0)
x_fit$ttable
```
```{r}
#Estimate MA(1) with mean=0
y <- arima.sim(list(order = c(0, 0, 1), ma = -.7), n = 200)
y_fit <- sarima(y, p = 0, d = 0, q = 1)
y_fit$ttable

```
```{r}
tsData_diff <- diff(log(tsData))
#AR(1) residual analysis
sarima(tsData_diff, p = 1, d = 0, q = 0)

#MA(2)residual analysis
sarima(tsData_diff, p = 0, d = 0, q = 2)

```
A time series exhibits ARIMA behavior if the differenced data has ARMA behavior
```{r}
# ARIMA(p = 1, d = 1, q = 0)
x <- arima.sim(list(order = c(1, 1, 0), ar = .9), n = 200)
plot(x, main = "ARIMA(p = 1, d = 1, q = 0)")
plot(diff(x), main = "ARMA(p = 1, d = 0, q = 0)")
```
```{r}
x <- arima.sim(list(order = c(1, 1, 0), ar = .9), n = 200)
#Plot ACF (autocorrelation function) and PACF of the ARIMA model
acf2(x)
```

```{r}
x <- arima.sim(list(order = c(1, 1, 0), ar = .9), n = 200)
#Use differenced data
acf2(diff(x))

```

##Chapter 6.6 ARMA/ARIMA Models (Cowpertwait and Metcalfe)
```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- arima.sim(n = 10000, list(ar = -0.6, ma = 0.5)) #simulate ARMA model
coef(arima(x, order = c(1, 0, 1))) #Find AR and MA coefficients of fitted ARMA(1, 1) model based on the simulated series x

```
```{r}
x.ts<- ts(x)
x.ma <- arima(x.ts, order = c(0, 0, 1)) #MA(1) model
x.ar <- arima(x.ts, order = c(1, 0, 0)) #AR(1) model
x.arma <- arima(x.ts, order = c(1, 0, 1)) #ARMA(1,1)
#Compare AICs
AIC(x.ma)
AIC(x.ar)
AIC(x.arma) 
```
## Find the best fit - choose the smallest value (28627.29)
```{r}

x.arma 
acf(resid(x.arma)) #show correlogram of residuals for the ARMA(1, 1) model fitted

```
##Example: Australian electricity production series 
The data exhibit a clear positive trend and a regular seasonal cycle. Furthermore, the variance increases with time, which suggests a log-transformation may be appropriate
```{r}
www <- "../../Data/cbe.dat" #load data 
CBE <- read.table(www, header = T)
Elec.ts <- ts(CBE[, 3], start = 1958, frequency = 12) #use monthly data
Time <- 1:length(Elec.ts)
Imth <- cycle(Elec.ts)
Elec.lm <- lm(log(Elec.ts) ~ Time + I(Time^2) + factor(Imth)) #A regression model is fitted to the logarithms of the original series
acf(resid(Elec.lm)) #correlogram of residuals

```
## Residuals appears to cycle with a period of 12 months suggesting that the monthly indicator variables are not sufficient to account for the seasonality in the series


```{r}
#Find best order with for loop with upper bounds on p and q - taken as 2

best.order <- c(0, 0, 0) #initial value
best.aic <- Inf # default to infinity
for (i in 0:2) for (j in 0:2) 
  {
  fit.aic <- AIC(arima(resid(Elec.lm), order = c(i, 0,j)))
  if (fit.aic < best.aic) 
    {
    best.order <- c(i, 0, j)
    best.arma <- arima(resid(Elec.lm), order = best.order)
    best.aic <- fit.aic
  }
}
best.order #show best.order

acf(resid(best.arma))
```
##Predict() produces forecasted values and errors. 
```{r}
new.time <- seq(length(Elec.ts), length = 36)
new.data <- data.frame(Time = new.time, Imth = rep(1:12,3)) # requires data frame
#Type lm
predict.lm <- predict(Elec.lm, new.data) #requires new data
#Type arma
predict.arma <- predict(best.arma, n.ahead = 36) #requires number of time steps to forecast

elec.pred <- ts(exp(predict.lm + predict.arma$pred), start = 1991,frequency = 12)

ts.plot(cbind(Elec.ts, elec.pred), lty = 1:2) #combine data with predicted values

```
##Seasonal autocorrelation observed in the residuals for the fitted model.

##Example: wave tank data
```{r}
www <- "../../Data/wave.dat" #load data 
wave.dat <- read.table(www, header = T)
attach (wave.dat)
layout(1:3)
plot (as.ts(waveht), ylab = 'Wave height')

acf (waveht)
pacf (waveht)
```
#The pacf suggests that p should be at least 2.

```{r}
wave.arma <- arima(waveht, order = c(4,0,4))
acf (wave.arma$res[-(1:4)])
pacf (wave.arma$res[-(1:4)])
hist(wave.arma$res[-(1:4)], xlab='height / mm', main='')
```
### The best-fitting ARMA(p, q) model, based on a minimum variance of residuals, was obtained with both p and q equal to 4. The acf and pacf of the residuals from this model are consistent with the residuals being a realisation of white noise

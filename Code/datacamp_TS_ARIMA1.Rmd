Analysis:  the AirPassengers dataset contains monthly information on airline passengers from 1949 through 1960. Note that when you plot ts objects using plot(), the data will automatically be plotted over time.
The AirPassengers data show a handful of important qualities, including seasonality, trend, and heteroscedasticity, which distinguish the data from standard white noise.

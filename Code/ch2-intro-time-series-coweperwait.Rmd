```{r}
data(AirPassengers)
AP <- AirPassengers
AP.decom <- decompose(AP, "multiplicative")
plot(ts(AP.decom$random[7:138]))
acf(AP.decom$random[7:138])


```

###Cosine shape is a characteristic of autoregressive model of order 2 or  a failed seasonal adjustment by **decom** function. We need to check the st dev

```{r}
sd(AP[7:138])
sd(AP[7:138] - AP.decom$trend[7:138])
sd(AP.decom$random[7:138])
##The reduction in the standard deviation shows that the seasonal adjustment has been very effective.

Fontdsdt.dat<- read.table("../Data/Fontdsdt.dat", header = TRUE)

```
Compute correlation:
Variant 1
```{r}
cov(x,y)/(sd(x)*sd(y))

```
Variant 2
```{r}
cor(x,y)
```
- regression approach  assumes a linear trend
- decompose smooths the time series without assuming any particular form for the trend.

###2.5 Summary of commands used in examples
```{r ignore=TRUE}

mean(x) # returns the mean (average)
var(x) #returns the variance with denominator n ??? 1
sd(x) #returns the standard deviation
cov(x,y) #returns the covariance with denominator n ??? 1
cor(x,y) #returns the correlation
acf(y, lag.max=10,plot=FALSE) #returns the correlogram (or sets the argument to obtain autocovariance function)

```
```{r}
Fontdsdt.dat<- read.table("../Data/Fontdsdt.dat", header = TRUE)
attach(Fontdsdt.dat)
plot(ts(adflow), ylab = 'adflow')
acf(adflow, xlab = 'lag (months)', main="")

```
Compute correlation:
Variant 1
```{r}
cov(x,y)/(sd(x)*sd(y))

```
Variant 2
```{r}
cor(x,y)
```

The main difference between the regression approach and using
decompose is that the former assumes a linear trend, whereas the latter
smooths the time series without assuming any particular form for the trend.

#3. Plot choc.ts. Decide if your model should be additive or multiplicative. Hint: compare with electricity data, does the variance of the chocolate data increase with the trend increase? 
```{r}

1. Calculate standard deviation for chocolate time series (not decomposed) #1

2. Calculate standard deviation for chocolate time series [12 indices removed] subtracting trend [12 indices removed] #2

3. Calculate standard deviation after seasonal adjustments [12 indices removed] #3

```{r}
Choc.ts1 <- ts(cbe[, 1], start = 1958, frequency = 12)
sd(Choc.ts1)
Choc.decomp1<- decompose(Choc.ts1, type="additive")
